    <p class="whyprivacytext">
        Your personal data is more than just numbers, it’s part of <strong>who you are</strong>. <br>In our connected world, this information is valuable 
        to companies and cybercriminals who might use it without your approval. <br>By protecting your privacy, you: <br>
        Avoid Identity Theft: Keeping personal details safe reduces the risk of fraud. <br>
        Stay in Control: You decide what to share and who sees it. <br>
        Prevent Manipulation: Fewer trackers mean fewer targeted ads or hidden influences on your decisions. <br>
        Keep Your Life Private: You can express yourself freely without being watched or judged. <br>
        Defend Your Rights: Privacy is a basic human right, and protecting it helps you stay secure and independent online. <br>
        Simple actions, like using strong passwords, limiting data on social media, or learning about privacy tools—can make 
        a big difference. Start now to reclaim your power and keep what’s truly yours, yours.
