        Everyone has her/his own privacy needs, and going higher will kill some comfort/convenience that some people don’t

    </em></p>

    <p>
        In our connected world, we share a lot of information online. Sometimes, we want to protect this information 
        from people or organizations that might be watching us (this is called <strong>surveillance</strong>). 
        A “threat model” is a way to figure out how much privacy and security you need in your daily life.
    </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Different people, different needs:</strong> Some people only want basic security, like using strong passwords and avoiding suspicious links. Others want very high levels of privacy, like using specialized apps or completely hiding their online identity.</li>
  <li><strong>Balancing privacy and convenience:</strong> The more you protect your privacy, the more work it can be. For example, turning off your phone’s location tracking keeps you safer but makes it harder to use navigation apps.</li>
  <li><strong>Finding what works for you:</strong> Decide how much privacy you need and how much convenience you’re willing to give up. If you want maximum privacy, expect extra effort or cost. If you loosen privacy controls, you allow more surveillance.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoiding privacy fatigue:</strong> Trying to shield absolutely everything can be exhausting. Tailoring your threat model to your own needs helps you focus on realistic steps without burning out.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Most importantly, remember that no tool or method is 100% secure.</strong> All protective measures can be bypassed or broken in some way.</p>

<h2>Common Threats</h2>
<p>Below are broad categories of threats. You may care about all, some, or none of these, depending on your own situation.</p>

<ol>
  <li class="threatmodelcommonthreatsorderedlist">
    <strong>Anonymity</strong><br>
    Involves hiding <em>who you are</em> when you go online. This is crucial for people who need to protect their real-life identity (e.g., whistleblowers or journalists).
  </li>
  <li class="threatmodelcommonthreatsorderedlist">
    <strong>Targeted Attacks</strong><br>
    Malicious actors specifically trying to access your data or devices. They might send you malware, exploit vulnerabilities in your software, or attempt to trick you into revealing sensitive information.
  </li>
  <li class="threatmodelcommonthreatsorderedlist">
    <strong>Passive Attacks</strong><br>
    Large-scale threats like malware infections or data breaches that affect many people at once. You don’t have to be individually targeted to get caught in a widespread attack.
  </li>
  <li class="threatmodelcommonthreatsorderedlist">
    <strong>Mass Surveillance</strong><br>
    Government or organizational programs that gather data on large groups of people—sometimes entire populations. They collect details like phone records, online activity, or location data.
  </li>
  <li class="threatmodelcommonthreatsorderedlist">
    <strong>Surveillance Capitalism</strong><br>
    Corporations (often advertising networks) collecting personal data to create detailed user profiles for profit. This includes data brokers, social media platforms, and analytics companies that track your actions online.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Anonymity vs. Privacy</h2>

<p>Most people use the words <strong>“anonymity”</strong> and <strong>“privacy”</strong> as if they had the same meaning, but <strong>they are not the same</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Anonymity</strong> means completely hiding <em>who you are</em>. You might use tools like Tor or other methods that disguise your identity.</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy</strong> means limiting how, when, and with whom your data is shared, without necessarily hiding who you are.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, whistleblowers or journalists may require near-total anonymity to protect their lives or work. Most people do not need to go that far, but still want to maintain privacy over personal information, messages, or browsing habits.</p>

    <h3>Final Note</h3>
    <p>
        Everyone’s situation is unique. Identify who might want your information, what data they might want,
        and why—then choose the mix of tools and practices that work best for you. 
        Balancing convenience and privacy is a personal decision, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution.
